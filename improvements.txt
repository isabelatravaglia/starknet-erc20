1- So that exercise 12 can be completed, before calling ex12_withdraw_from_contract(), you first need to call ex11_claimed_from_contract(), so that the ex12_withdraw_from_contract() function can withdraw the amount that was minted in ex11_claimed_from_contract(); This should have been explained or ex12_withdraw_from_contract() function should have executed the mint before calling the withdraw function. The same happens with exercises 17 and 18.
2- It seems that on exercise 13, unlike stated in the instructions, the Evaluator is not checking if the Evaluator contract is authorized to manipulate the tokens. Instead it is actually checking if the ExerciseSolution contract is authorized to manipulate the tokens. So the instruction should be changed to "Mint some DTK tokens and use Voyager to authorize your contract ("exerciseSolution") to manipulate them.", or the Evaluator contract should have its logic changed.
3- On exercise 15, the Evaluator doesn't evaluate the return of the deposit_tokens function.
4- In some exercises, when minting tokens was necessary, the contract needed to hold tokens, so the recipient of the initial supply had to 1) approve her tokens and 2) transfer them to the contract. Is there a way to deploy the token contract and mint the initial supply to itself?
5- On exercise 18 there isn't an explicit instruction to add a burn functionality to the wrap token. It took me a couple of attempts to realize that, so maybe expliciting it could speed up the exercise conclusion.
